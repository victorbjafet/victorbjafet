Hi! I'm Victor, a student passionate about CS/EE/CE.
I occasionally try to take on personal projects (that always die due to lack of free time), but whatever I do I usually put here!
Check out my pinned repos! They're the projects I'm most proud of.
You can reach me at victorbjafet@gmail.com.
Thanks for stopping by!
