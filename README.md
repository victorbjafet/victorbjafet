Hi! I'm Victor, a highschool class of 2025 student passionate about CS/EE/CE.

I occasionally try to take on personal projects (that always die due to lack of free time), but whatever I do I usually put here!

Check out my pinned repos! They're the projects I'm most proud of.

Thanks for stopping by!

Current projects I'm focusing on:
- Sigmath backend (in-class project, private for now)
- API based scrapers/watchers
  - https://github.com/victorbjafet/satWatch
  - https://github.com/victorbjafet/naviance_snipe
  - planning to possibly make some for checking when college decisions release? might be fun
  - also one for grabbing class slots that would be a fun challenge
- Science Olympiad Robot Tour and Electric Vehicle
