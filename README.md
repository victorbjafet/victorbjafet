Hi! I'm Victor, a highschool class of 2025 student passionate about CS/EE/CE.

I occasionally try to take on random personal projects (that tend to die due to lack of free time), but whatever I do I usually put on GitHub!

Check out my pinned repos! They're the projects I'm most proud of.

Thanks for stopping by!

Current projects I'm focusing on:
- [Data Architecture class](https://github.com/victorbjafet/data_architecture)
- Science Olympiad Robot Tour and Electric Vehicle (private)

Project plans:
- Improved ease of use Skyward attendance checker
